        <p>Tater tots are a fantastic food because they go with almost anything as a side. Tater tots are unmatched as a side at breakfast, lunch, OR dinner. Heck, sometimes I even have some tater tots all by themselves! Check my recipe below so you can enjoy some of this crispy goodnes</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried dill</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped resh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until parboiled, about 6-7 minutes; drain well and let cool.</li>
            <li>Using a box grater, finely shred potatoes. Using a clean dish towel or cheese cloth, drain potatoes completely, removing as much water as possible.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Stir in flour, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and dill; season with salt and pepper, to taste. The mixture should be workable but dry. Form potatoes into tots.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add tots to the skillet, 5 or 6 at a time, and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (4 to 6 medium lemons)</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a simply syrup by combining sugar and water in a small saucepan and bringing it to a simmer over low heat. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Juice your lemons, 4 to 6 medium lemons should do the trick for 1 cup of juice but you may need more or less depending on the size of your lemons. </li>
            <li>Pour the juice and simple syrup into a serving pitcher. </li>
            <li>Add 2 to 3 cups of cold water to your pitcher to dilute and taste as needed.</li>
            <li>Optional: If your lemonade is too sweet, add lemon juice as needed.</li>
        </ol>

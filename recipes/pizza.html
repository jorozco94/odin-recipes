        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of my absolute favorite foods is pizza. Nothing beats the simiplicity and classic flavor of a pepperoni pizza so below I've laid out a quick recipe for how to make a pizza of your own.</p>
        <p>For this recipe you won't need a fancy pizza oven, but as you progress on your cooking journey I recommend one to really elevate your pizza!</p>

            <li>16 ounces pizza dough</li>

            <li>20+ slices of pepperoni</li>
            <li>12 oz mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh or dried oregano, optional</li>
            <li>Flour as needed for rolling and shapinpg dough</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500F</li>

            <li>Sprinkle your mozzarella cheese over the sauce and add pepperoni to your hearts content.</li>
            <li>Season pizza with black pepper.</li>
            <li>Slide your pizza pan into the oven and cook for 18-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the pizza rest for a minute when it's finished, and slice into pieces. Add oregano (optional).</li>
